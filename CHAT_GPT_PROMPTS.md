# App Description

I am building an application called bot-letter. The app allows users to create custom
newsletters for personal consumption. The user enters a description of the type of news
they'd like to receive and, each morning, the bot will curate relevant articles from the
past 24 hours, summarize them and send them in a newsletter to the user.
